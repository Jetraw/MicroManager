# Jetraw Micro-Manager, the Jetraw and Dpcore plug-ins for MM. 

This is the public repository for Jetraw and DPcore plug-ins compatible with Micro-Manager. For more info visit:
https://www.jetraw.com/


## Requirements
- Jetraw installed on a Windows computer (MacOS and Linux coming soon) and installation folder must be in PATH environment variable.
- For writing compressed files a valid License is needed. 

## Installation
You will need to have the following JAR files for installation:

- MMJ_.jar
- DpcorePlugin.jar
- JetrawSaverPlugin.jar

Replace MMJ_.jar in your MicroManager folder:
path_to_micromanager\plugins\Micro-Manager\

Copy your .jar plug-ins file into:
path_to_micromanager\mmplugins\

## Usage
Once all .jar files have been replaced/copied, you should be able to prepare an acquired image with dpcore and save a jetraw compressed version of it during acquisition.
In MicroManager you will need to add the following processes using the plug-in section On-the-fly Image Processing.
Select Dpcore Plug-in and Jetraw Saver in this order (order matters).

You should have the following pipeline configuration:

MicroManager pipeline configuration


In the configuration section of Jetraw Saver Plug-in you can choose the output folder for your compressed images.

Then you are ready to do an acquisition which prepares the images and saves a compressed copy of it.

Acquisition of 40 frames, 20 time points and 2 slices 


After the acquisition is performed if you have used the Jetraw Saver Plug-in, a Jetraw compressed TIFF file will be located at the folder you previously indicated. You have two options to display this compressed image:

- Decompress the image using Jetraw's UI or command line tool, and display the decompressed image using ImageJ/Fiji or MicroManager, all options are capable of reading the dimensional and time coordinates generated by the acquisition.

- Display directly the compressed image using Jetraw's Native Fiji Plug-in or Jetraw's Bio-Formats Plug-in. The Fiji Native plug-in does not have the option to read the different dimensional and time coordinates from MicroManagerâ€™s acquisition at the moment, it just displays the whole amount of frames from the TIFF file.
